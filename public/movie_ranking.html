<h1>The Best Movies According to Maher</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Totoro</h3>
<p>One of my favourite anime. It makes me think about my younger sister all the time. Though I don't like her much but I do, too.</p>

<h3>Spy x Family</h3>
<p>I like the role of Annya in this anime and the way she speaks. Can't wait for the new season.</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>My all time close to heart animated movie, as it gives statement that everyone should hear once in a life. </p>
